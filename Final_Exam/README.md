Instruction to run code
1. Download the three dataset files as dataset1.csv,... dataset3.csv
2. Place files in a working folder that you can create anywhere
3. Place transform.py in that folder
4. Code was written for Python2.7, so you might need to change the chebang line to python3 as per your machine
5. Simply run code and review results in terminal where the mean error will be posted after being computed for each dataset one by one
6. That completes the test run
